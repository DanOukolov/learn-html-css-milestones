    </p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp#:~:text=The%20tag%20defines%20a,after%20each%20element.">Paragraph Tag</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">a Tag</a>
    <div>
        <p>Explanation 1: The a tag is a child of the p tag because it is nested inside</p>
        <br>
        <p>Explanation 2: The opening p tag must be closed by a normal p tag but just with a / before the p</p>
        <br>
        <p>Attributes of the a tag: The a tag has an id, hyper reference attribute, and a class, and a target.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The id is "the-best-link" the class is "banana" and the target is "_blank"</p>
        <br> 
        <p>The id is the most specfic way to reference the tag while styling. There can only be on tag assigned with a specific id.
            The class is the next most specfic way to reference the tag. There can be many tags with a specific class. 
            The target is basically the back up if the link does not work.
